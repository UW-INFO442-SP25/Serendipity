## Our Focus
We aim to address Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3): Good Health and Well-Being by improving the long-term management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). OSAS affects over 936 million adults globally, but treatment adherence is often low. Our platform focuses on enhancing treatment adherence, emotional motivation, and health literacy by addressing barriers like discomfort with CPAP devices, lack of real-time feedback, emotional disengagement, and limited access to affordable treatment options. We envision a digital tool that empowers patients with personalized support and information for better health outcomes.

## Features 
- **User Sign-up/Login**: Secure registration and login to track progress and access personalized features.
- **Home (About/Overview)**: Introduction to the platform and its mission to support individuals with OSAS.
- **Discussion Forum**: A community space where users can share experiences, advice, and emotional support.
- **Educational Resources Page**: Access articles, videos, and guides on managing OSAS, CPAP usage, and improving overall health.
- **Behavior Tracker**: Monitor CPAP usage and symptoms like fatigue levels, providing real-time insights into treatment effectiveness.
